# Satellite Swarm Reconfiguration: Fuel-Optimal and Fault-Tolerant Control

This repository contains the full MATLAB simulation suite developed for my senior thesis at Princeton University, titled:

**“Fuel-Optimal Dynamic Reconfiguration Algorithms for Satellite Swarms in LEO”**

## 🚀 Overview

The project explores fuel-efficient trajectory planning and distributed control strategies for satellite swarms operating in low Earth orbit (LEO). It focuses on scalable, autonomous reconfiguration under realistic conditions including:

- Drift-based triggering logic
- Fault-tolerant leader failure
- Initial state perturbations
- Collision avoidance under nonlinear dynamics
- Optimization with convex (CVX) and nonlinear (fmincon) solvers

All simulations are conducted in the LVLH frame using Clohessy-Wiltshire dynamics and tested against parameters from NASA's Starling mission.
